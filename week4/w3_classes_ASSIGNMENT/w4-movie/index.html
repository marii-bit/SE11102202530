                    <em>Spider-Man</em> Superhero film that follows Peter Parker, a high school student who gains spider-like abilities after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider. As he learns to control his powers, Peter discovers the true meaning of heroism when faced with tragedy and danger. Spider-Man has the secret identity of Peter Benjamin Parker. Initially, Peter was depicted as a teenage high-school student and an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents, Richard and Mary Parker, died in a plane crash. Lee, Ditko, and later creators had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and young adulthood and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and enemies such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story, Peter gets his superhuman spider powers and abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. These powers include superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability, coordination, and balance; clinging to surfaces and ceilings like a spider; and detecting danger with his precognition ability called "spider-sense". He builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design, which he uses both for fighting and travel, or "web swinging" across the city. Peter Parker initially used his powers for personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a thief that he could have stopped but did not, Peter began to use his powers to fight crime as Spider-Man.
